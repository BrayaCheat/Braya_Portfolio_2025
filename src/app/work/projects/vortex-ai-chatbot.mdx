## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was handling Markdown formatting correctly while integrating the Gemini API. Ensuring the chatbot could process and render Markdown properly—without breaking formatting or misinterpreting syntax—was trickier than expected. Issues like inconsistent rendering, escaping special characters, and handling edge cases in user inputs required constant debugging and adjustments. Additionally, fine-tuning the prompt structure to get more accurate and context-aware responses from the Gemini API was a major learning experience.

## Outcome

After multiple iterations and debugging sessions, the chatbot now processes Markdown more reliably, improving response clarity and formatting. Optimizing API calls and refining the way prompts are structured have significantly enhanced the chatbot’s accuracy and usability. While challenges remain, the experience has provided valuable insights into working with AI APIs and handling structured text effectively.
