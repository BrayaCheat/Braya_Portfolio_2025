## Overview

A sleek and performance-driven developer portfolio designed to highlight my skills, experience, and project work. Built with **Next.js** and styled using **Once UI**, the portfolio provides an engaging and responsive user experience across all devices. **[Github Repo](https://github.com/BrayaCheat/Braya-Next-Portfolio)**

## Key Features

- **Next.js Framework**
  Leveraged Next.js for server-side rendering, dynamic routing, and optimal performance with static site generation.

- **Once UI Integration**
  Used the elegant component library from **Once UI** to maintain design consistency and speed up development with modular, reusable UI components.

- **Fully Responsive Design**
  Tailored for both desktop and mobile screens with clean typography, intuitive layout, and smooth page transitions.

- **MDX-Driven Content**
  Projects and blog posts are powered by **MDX**, allowing content and code to live side-by-side for better flexibility and control.

- **Dark Mode Support**
  Implemented dark/light theme toggle using system preference detection to enhance visual comfort and accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – React-based framework for building fast, scalable web apps
- **Once UI** – Beautiful prebuilt component system for rapid UI development
- **MDX** – Write content in Markdown with embedded JSX components
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling to create a modern, clean interface
- **Vercel** – For seamless deployment and global CDN delivery

## Challenges and Learnings

As someone new to **Next.js**, the biggest challenge was understanding its file-based routing system, data fetching strategies, and how to properly manage layouts with MDX. Through documentation, debugging, and trial-and-error, I gained confidence in building scalable apps with server-side capabilities. This portfolio project became both a personal brand asset and a hands-on learning journey into fullstack frontend development.
