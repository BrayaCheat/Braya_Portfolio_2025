## Overview

A fully responsive drink ordering system developed for **MN Juicy**, allowing customers to browse, customize, and place orders seamlessly via mobile — with orders instantly routed to Telegram for staff response. **[Github Repo](https://github.com/BrayaCheat/MN-Juicy-2024)**

## Key Features

- **Mobile-First Digital Menu**
  Developed with **Nuxt.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, the menu is optimized for all screen sizes with dynamic category filtering, product visibility, and an intuitive user interface.

- **Real-Time Telegram Notification**
  Orders are sent directly to a **Telegram channel**, providing instant alerts to staff and reducing customer wait time.

- **Leaflet-Based Map Location Picker**
  Users can drop a pin on an interactive **Leaflet.js map** to specify their delivery location — simplifying the process with only name, phone, and location required.

- **QR Code Accessibility**
  Designed for quick access — customers scan a QR code, browse, and order without needing to install anything or create an account.

- **Optimized Cloud Deployment**
  Hosted on **Vercel**, ensuring low latency, global content delivery, and minimal downtime for a consistently smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Nuxt.js** – For building a performant, server-rendered frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** – For fast, clean, and fully responsive UI styling
- **Leaflet.js** – For location picking with map interaction
- **Telegram Bot API** – For real-time notification integration
- **Vercel** – For modern cloud deployment and continuous delivery

## Challenges and Learnings

The key challenge was designing a checkout flow that balances simplicity and accuracy — especially with delivery locations. By leveraging **Leaflet.js** and handling edge cases like missing or unclear user inputs, the system became both user-friendly and operationally reliable. This project sharpened skills in **map integration, real-time APIs,** and **end-to-end deployment** — all while solving a real business problem.
